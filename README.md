# AggieHacks2021

The purpose of this project is to model the effect of the pandemic on the number of homeless people, specifically in California. For this Hackathon, the process can be broken down into the following steps

1. Understanding the driving factors
2. Research appropriate and relevant datasets
3. Data cleaning and EDA
4. Feature Engineering
5. Regression

## Understanding driving factors

According to a report done by the National league of Cities (NLC) (1), there are 5 distinct driving factors for homeless people. Though the root cause is extremely complex, the common factors that come up, can be categorized as:

- House Affordability
- Income Stagnation
- Racial Disparities
- Mental Health and Substance Use
- Domestic Violence
